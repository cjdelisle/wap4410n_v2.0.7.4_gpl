.SH NAME
snmpdf - gets a listing of disk space usage on a remote machine via SNMP
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpdf [ common arguments ] [-Cu] hostname
.SH DESCRIPTION
snmpdf is simply a networked verison of the typical df command.  It
checks the disk space on the remote machine by examining the
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB's hrStorageTable or the UCD-SNMP-MIB's dskTable.
By default, the hrStorageTable is prefered as it typically contains
more information.  However, the -Cu argument can be passed to snmpdf
to force the usage of the dskTable.
.PP
See the
.I snmpd.conf(5)
manual page on setting up the dskTable using the 
.I disk
directive in the snmpd.conf file.
